# fashion - designed and developed by Cameron Conway

The focus of this project was to design and build a luxury clothing brand landing page, with influence coming from https://www.armani.com/en-gb/, https://www.cerruti.com/gb/ and https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/). I aimed to create something that matched the experience and feeling of affluence, exclusivity and sophistication.

## Technologies

The project is built using the frontend JavaScript library [React](https://reactjs.org/) along with TypeScript, styling is dealt with using SCSS following the BEM methodology.
